Current Tasks
=============

> Return null where possible instead of throwing exceptions when something's not found.

> Rename the core collection in listing types to just be "Items" instead of having reference to the collection member type.

> Move the path generation code into the respective entities.

> Allow global indexes now we don't have conflict issues on the single file indexes.

> Combine entity and implementation files for logical grouping.

> Make each entity generate all of its own index entries rather than a template which gets expanded. This gives better flexibility on generating custom indexes.
